# D3-Macros  
Herein I present a Python script with a GUI I made for personal use to reduce tedium while playing the video game Diablo 3. Of course, this was a project I undertook for fun. It helped me branch out into multi-processing and GUI construction. I don't play video games enough for this to be useful anymore, so I haven't kept it up to date. It used to work flawlessly and could easily be transferred to other computers.  

# Challenges  
The primary challenge of the project was that there are many activities to be done, potentially, at the same time with varying different triggers. Multi-processing was key. Another challenge was communicating the keyboard shortcuts to others I shared it with. I made a GUI with instructions to guide them. It also helped me remember everything when coming back from a break. Ultimately, I find the code very efficient. As I was working on the project, I would rebuild it from the ground up occasionally to make sure the new ideas and understanding I gained were fully implemented.
